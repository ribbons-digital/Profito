  title: What is Profito
  description: >
    A tool that helps you stay in profit by getting the right answers to the key
    questions that are crucial for your business.
description: >-
  Profito helps you calculate the gross profit of an existing product you are
  selling or determine the suggested cost (FOB price) of a new product you plan
  to sell in the future. It achieves it by asking a few questions about your
  business such as your current pricing strategy and distribution channels.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
